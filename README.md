PASN: Propitious Aggregation of Social Networks
===============================================

*IMPORTANT: It is very likely that this application no longer works -- it is provided here simply for archival purposes.*

PASN is an online data-collection instrument designed to conduct surveys involving ego-centric social network data. PASN can utilize personal network data that has been "propitiously" articulated by users of popular social network sites like Facebook. PASN uses PHP and AJAX to provide an easy-to-use participant interface, and MySQL to store survey data. Features include:

*Ability to construct surveys using multiple question types
*Social network name-generator interface using user-definable questions/alter categories
*SNS contact import interface facilitates name-generation by importing existing contact lists
*Drag-and-drop interface for questions regarding personal contacts. Example survey item: "These people would loan me $50 so I could go away for a weekend"
*Allows for user authentication and longitudinal data tracking
